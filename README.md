# anme3evo-code

This repository contains original code written by the authors for the forthcoming publication "Convergence and horizontal gene transfer drive the evolution of anaerobic methanotrophy in archaea" by Woods et al.

The scripts ``parse-function-frequency.py`` and ``format-enrichment-input.py`` are helper scripts for ``anvi-script-frequency-enrichment.sh`` and were not used independently in this work. Similarly, the script ``deduplicate-synteny.py`` is a helper script for ``anvi-script-extract-synteny-groups.sh`` and was not used independently.
